    Fixed deadlock when logging from a tpool thread.

    The object server runs certain IO-intensive methods outside the
    main pthread for performance. Previously, if one of those methods
    tried to log, this can cause a crash that eventually leads to an
    object server with hundreds or thousands of greenthreads, all
    deadlocked. The fix is to use a mutex that works across different
    greenlets and different pthreads.

    Fixed a rare issue where multiple backend timeouts could result
    in bad data being returned to the client.

  - >
    Removed a race condition where a POST to an SLO could modify the
    X-Static-Large-Object metadata.

  - >
    Fixed a cache invalidation issue related to GET and PUT requests to
    containers that would occasionally cause object PUTs to a container to
    404 after the container had been successfully created.
